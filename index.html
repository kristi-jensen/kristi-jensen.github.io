	<h2 id="chrbioH">Chromosome Biology</h2>
	<p>Our lab studies various aspects of chromosome biology ranging from the maintenance of chromosome ends by telomerase to the effects of hybridization, ploidy changes and unisexual reproduction in the context of evolution.</p>

		<h3>Telomeres &amp Telomerase</h3>
		<p class="slideText">We study telomerase biogenesis with a particular interest in the processing of the ncRNA subunit and the mechanisms that regulate the amount of telomerase activity in the cell.</p>

		<h3>Meiosis &amp Reproduction</h3>
		<p class="slideText">We are interested in the cellular and molecular mechanisms that trigger a switch to parthenogenesis (virgin birth) and permit females of some species to reproduce clonally over many generations.</p>

		<h3>Hybridization &amp Ploidy</h3>
		<p class="slideText">Lizards of the genus <EM>Aspidoscelis</EM> provide a fascinating system to examine the effects of hybridization and ploidy changes on gene expression, development and fitness.</p>
